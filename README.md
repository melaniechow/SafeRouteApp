# Our inspiration

We believe everyone should feel secure when walking home at night. However, our fear of traveling alone is justified. Criminal activity is a major social issue, particularly in the streets of New York City. Our app SafeRoute compiles data from New York City's police reports to map out the safest and fastest travel routes to any destination in NYC. 

# Background

We are passionate about using technology for social improvement. As girls, we were constantly told to be cautious rather than confident, particularly when walking alone on the streets. Having an app to help us avoid dangerous situations is empowering. 
While the team has varying levels of experience with technology, we all have a basic background in programming. Therefore, we decided to combine our skills and creativity to develop an app meaningful to us. Along the way, we developed valuable teamwork and problem solving skills. 

# SafeRouteApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

# How to use

SafeRoute has two primary components: route identification and risk area mapping. When you want to travel to a location, simply enter your method of travel, origin, and destination to choose the safest and most efficient route available. You will also be notified of dangerous spots in close proximity.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
